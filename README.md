## Project Description:  

*Gitlet* is a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of Git. It is implemented in Java and is a command-line application. It is designed to be used by a single user on a single computer. It is not a distributed version-control system.

A version-control system is essentially a backup system for related collections of files. The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:

1. Saving the contents of entire directories of files, called *commits*.

2. Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits, called *checking out*.

3. Viewing the history of your backups, called *log*.

4. Maintaining related sequences of commits, called *branches*.

5. Merging changes made in one branch into another.

This project is adapted from University of California, Berkeley's CS 61B Data Structures course project. The original project description can be found [here](https://cs61bl.org/su20/projects/gitlet/#acknowledgments).
